### Network Security Projects For Phising Data

üìò Project Overview: Phishing Detection via Network Security
This project is a machine learning-based network security solution designed to detect phishing attempts in network traffic. It provides a FastAPI-powered web application for real-time predictions and training, integrated with modern tools for scalable deployment and CI/CD automation.

üéØ Project Purpose
The application aims to identify phishing activities using network traffic data. It features:

A FastAPI web service for prediction and training

MongoDB integration for data persistence

Docker and AWS support for deployment

A modular architecture for maintainability and scalability

üß© Core Application Files
File	Description
app.py	Main FastAPI web server handling API endpoints
main.py	Secondary core script, possibly for CLI or bootstrapping
push_data.py	Responsible for pushing data into the database
test_mongodb.py	Contains tests to validate MongoDB operations
setup.py	Project metadata and setup configuration

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Setup

üöÄ Application Functionality
‚úÖ FastAPI Web Interface (app.py)
/train: Triggers the training pipeline

/predict: Accepts a CSV input for phishing prediction

HTML front-end interface for user interaction

üß† Machine Learning Pipeline
Located in networksecurity/pipeline/training_pipeline.py

Trains and stores a custom NetworkModel with preprocessing

Outputs saved to final_model/ and prediction_output/

üóÉÔ∏è Data Management
Raw data in Network_Data/

Processed data in valid_data/

Results and artifacts are logged and organized

üåê Infrastructure & Deployment
Containerization: Docker support for local and cloud environments

Cloud Deployment: Compatible with AWS EC2, with ECR integration

CI/CD: GitHub Actions set up under .github/

Environment Configuration: Uses .env or similar for secrets and MongoDB connection

üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup
Written in Python

All dependencies managed via requirements.txt

MongoDB for persistent storage

Template-based HTML UI via FastAPI and Jinja2

üß± Project Architecture
Follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

Data Ingestion

Training Pipeline

Prediction Service

Web Interface

Logging & Monitoring

Deployment Automation
